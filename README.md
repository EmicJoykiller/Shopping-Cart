This Dessert Shop web application is an interactive e-commerce platform that allows users to explore a collection of delightful desserts, including cupcakes, macarons, pretzels, and ice cream. The application features a dynamic shopping cart system built using vanilla JavaScript, enabling users to add items to their cart, view item counts, and see real-time updates for subtotal, taxes, and total costs.

The shopping cart uses an isCartShowing state to toggle visibility, enhancing the user experience with a seamless show/hide functionality. The cart system is managed by a custom ShoppingCart class, which includes methods for adding items, calculating totals, computing taxes, and clearing the cart.

Key Features:

Product Display: Dynamically generated dessert cards showcasing name, price, category, and an "Add to Cart" button.
Shopping Cart Management: Real-time updates on the total number of items, subtotal, taxes, and overall total.
State Management: Utilizes a custom ShoppingCart class to manage items, calculations, and UI updates.
User Interaction: Clear cart confirmation to prevent accidental deletions, and a toggle button to show/hide the cart.
Dynamic UI Updates: DOM manipulation using JavaScript to update item counts and totals without page reloads.
This project demonstrates core web development principles, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and object-oriented programming in JavaScript, making it an excellent showcase of frontend development skills.
